            Association (HRA) at a young age and became involved in revolutionary activities. He participated in several
            acts of sabotage against British institutions, including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly

        <p>Vallabhbhai Patel (born October 31, 1875, Nadiad, Gujarat, India—died December 15, 1950, Bombay [now Mumbai])
            was an Indian barrister and statesman, one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress during the

            Patel was born into a self-sufficient landowning family of the Leva Patidar caste. Reared in an atmosphere
            of traditional Hinduism, he attended primary school at Karamasad and high school at Petlad but was mainly
            self-taught. Patel married at the age of 16, matriculated at 22, and passed the district pleader’s
            examination, which enabled him to practice law. In 1900 he set up an independent office of district pleader
