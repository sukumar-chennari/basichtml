        <summary><b>Ratan Tata</b></summary>
        <p>Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of
            Tata Sons. He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October 2016
            through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts.[2][3] In 2008, he received the Padma
            Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest
            civilian honour in 2000.[4]

            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata
            Group. He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
            architecture.[5] He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded
            J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group
            acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group
            into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around
            60–65% of his income to charity.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Achievements</b> <br>
            In 1961 after returning to India Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group. His first job involved working with the
            blue-collar employees at Tata Steel Ltd in Jamshedpur. “It was a total waste of time — I was shuffled around
            from department to department, but nobody actually told me what to do! I guess, I was looked at as a family
            member, so no one said anything to me — but I spent 6 months just trying to make myself look ‘useful’,” Tata
            said. He worked as an apprentice on the shop floor and his responsibilities included shoveling limestone and
            working with the furnaces.

        <summary><b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b></summary>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920), the man who reshaped twentieth-century mathematics with his various
            contributions in several mathematical domains, including mathematical analysis, infinite series, continued
            fractions, number theory, and game theory is recognized as one of history's greatest mathematicians. Leaving
            this world at the youthful age of 32, Ramanujan made significant contributions to mathematics that only a
            few others could match in their lifetime. Surprisingly, he never received any formal mathematics training.
            Most of his mathematical discoveries were based only on intuition and were ultimately proven correct. With
            its humble and sometimes difficult start, his life story is just as fascinating as his incredible work.
            Every year, Ramanujan’s birth anniversary on December 22 is observed as National Mathematics Day.

            Born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramanujan demonstrated an exceptional intuitive grasp of mathematics at a
            young age. Despite being a mathematical prodigy, Ramanujan's career did not begin well. He received a
            college scholarship in 1904, but he quickly lost it by failing in nonmathematical subjects. Another attempt
            at college in Madras (now Chennai) ended in failure when he failed his First Arts exam. It was around this
            time that he began his famous notebooks. He drifted through poverty until 1910 when he was interviewed by R.
            Ramachandra Rao, secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was initially sceptical of Ramanujan, but
            he eventually recognised his abilities and supported him financially.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Achievements</b><br>
            The year after his death, Nature listed Ramanujan among other distinguished scientists and mathematicians on
            a "Calendar of Scientific Pioneers" who had achieved eminence.[128] Ramanujan's home state of Tamil Nadu
            celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan's birthday) as 'State IT Day'. Stamps picturing Ramanujan were issued by
            the government of India in 1962, 2011, 2012 and 2016.[129]
