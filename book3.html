    <pre>
        If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was
        born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before
        they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you
        want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents
        would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're
        quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're nice and all--I'm not saying
        that--but they're also touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam
        autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around
        last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean
        that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That isn't too far from
        this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He's going to
        drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little
        English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand
        bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he
        was home. He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never
        heard of him. The best one in it was "The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that
        wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me.
        Now he's out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies.
        Don't even mention them to me.
        Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this school that's in
        Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've probably seen the ads, anyway. They
        advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hotshot guy on a horse jumping
        over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once
        saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always

                They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old, or even more
        than that. They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of course. I know that
        sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean that I used to think about old Spencer
        quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you wondered what the heck he was still
        living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he had very terrible posture, and in class,
        whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to
        get up and pick it up and hand it to him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about
        him just enough and not too much, you could figure it out that he wasn't doing too bad for
        himself. For instance, one Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate,
        he showed us this old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian
        in Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's what I
        mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying
        a blanket.
        His door was open, but I sort of knocked on it anyway, just to be polite and all. I could see where
        he was sitting. He was sitting in a big leather chair, all wrapped up in that blanket I just told you
        about. He looked over at me when I knocked. "Who's that?" he yelled. "Caulfield? Come in,
        boy." He was always yelling, outside class. It got on your nerves sometimes.
        The minute I went in, I was sort of sorry I'd come. He was reading the Atlantic Monthly, and
        there were pills and medicine all over the place, and everything smelled like Vicks Nose Drops. It
        was pretty depressing. I'm not too crazy about sick people, anyway. What made it even more
        depressing, old Spencer had on this very sad, ratty old bathrobe that he was probably born in or
        something. I don't much like to see old guys in their pajamas and bathrobes anyway. Their bumpy
        old chests are always showing. And their legs. Old guys' legs, at beaches and places, always look
        so white and unhairy. "Hello, sir," I said. "I got your note. Thanks a lot." He'd written me this
        note asking me to stop by and say good-by before vacation started, on account of I wasn't coming
        back. "You didn't have to do all that. I'd have come over to say good-by anyway."
        "Have a seat there, boy," old Spencer said. He meant the bed.
        I sat down on it. "How's your grippe, sir?"
        "M'boy, if I felt any better I'd have to send for the doctor," old Spencer said. That knocked him
        out. He started chuckling like a madman. Then he finally straightened hims

                I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to the store to buy
        a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the
        opera. It's terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym and get my equipment and
        stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don't even keep my goddam equipment in the gym.
        Where I lived at Pencey, I lived in the Ossenburger Memorial Wing of the new dorms. It was
        only for juniors and seniors. I was a junior. My roommate was a senior. It was named after this
        guy Ossenburger that went to Pencey. He made a pot of dough in the undertaking business after
        he got out of Pencey. What he did, he started these undertaking parlors all over the country that
        you could get members of your family buried for about five bucks apiece. You should see old
        Ossenburger. He probably just shoves them in a sack and dumps them in the river. Anyway, he
        gave Pencey a pile of dough, and they named our wing alter him. The first football game of the
        year, he came up to school in this big goddam Cadillac, and we all had to stand up in the
        grandstand and give him a locomotive--that's a cheer. Then, the next morning, in chapel, be made
        a speech that lasted about ten hours. He started off with about fifty corny jokes, just to show us
        what a regular guy he was. Very big deal. Then he started telling us how he was never ashamed,
        when he was in some kind of trouble or something, to get right down his knees and pray to God.
        He told us we should always pray to God--talk to Him and all--wherever we were. He told us we
        ought to think of Jesus as our buddy and all. He said he talked to Jesus all the time. Even when he
        was driving his car. That killed me. I just see the big phony bastard shifting into first gear and
        asking Jesus to send him a few more stiffs. The only good part of his speech was right in the
        middle of it. He was telling us all about what a swell guy he was, what a hot-shot and all, then all
        of a sudden this guy sitting in the row in front of me, Edgar Marsalla, laid this terrific fart. It was
        a very crude thing to do, in chapel and all, but it was also quite amusing. Old Marsalla. He damn
        near blew the roof off. Hardly anybody laughed out loud, and old Ossenburger made out like he
        didn't even hear it, but old Thurmer, the headmaster, was sitting right next to him on the rostrum
        and all, and you could tell he heard it. Boy, was he sore. He didn't say anything then, but the next
        night he made us have compulsory study hall in the academic building and he came up and made
        a speech. He said that the boy that had created the disturbance in chapel wasn't fit to go to
        Pencey. We tried to get old Marsalla to rip off another one, right while old Thurmer was making
        his speech, but be wasn't in the right mood. Anyway, that's where I lived at Pencey. Old
        Ossenburger Memorial Wing, in the new dorms.

                I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while
        he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody was still down at the game.
        It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There were about ten washbowls, all right
        against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat down on the one right next to him and started
        turning the cold water on and off--this nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling 'Song of
        India" while he shaved. He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in
        tune, and he always picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler,
        like "Song of India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up.
        You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well, so was
        Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right,
        Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always
        rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always
        looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you
        knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly
        in love with himself. He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was
        pretty handsome, too--I'll admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your
        parents saw his picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say, "Who's this boy?" I mean he
        was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were a
        lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn't look handsome if you saw their pictures in the

    <pre>
                We always had the same meal on Saturday nights at Pencey. It was supposed to be a big deal,
        because they gave you steak. I'll bet a thousand bucks the reason they did that was because a lot
        of guys' parents came up to school on Sunday, and old Thurmer probably figured everybody's
        mother would ask their darling boy what he had for dinner last night, and he'd say, "Steak." What
        a racket. You should've seen the steaks. They were these little hard, dry jobs that you could
        hardly even cut. You always got these very lumpy mashed potatoes on steak night, and for dessert
        you got Brown Betty, which nobody ate, except maybe the little kids in the lower school that
        didn't know any better--and guys like Ackley that ate everything.
        It was nice, though, when we got out of the dining room. There were about three inches of snow
        on the ground, and it was still coming down like a madman. It looked pretty as hell, and we all
        started throwing snowballs and horsing around all over the place. It was very childish, but
        everybody was really enjoying themselves.
        I didn't have a date or anything, so I and this friend of mine, Mal Brossard, that was on the
        wrestling team, decided we'd take a bus into Agerstown and have a hamburger and maybe see a
        lousy movie. Neither of us felt like sitting around on our ass all night. I asked Mal if he minded if
        Ackley came along with us. The reason I asked was because Ackley never did anything on
        Saturday night, except stay in his room and squeeze his pimples or something. Mal said he didn't
        mind but that he wasn't too crazy about the idea. He didn't like Ackley much. Anyway, we both
        went to our rooms to get ready and all, and while I was putting on my galoshes and crap, I yelled
        over and asked old Ackley if he wanted to go to the movies. He could hear me all right through
        the shower curtains, but he didn't answer me right away. He was the kind of a guy that hates to
        answer you right away. Finally he came over, through the goddam curtains, and stood on the
        shower ledge and asked who was going besides me. He always had to know who was going. I
        swear, if that guy was shipwrecked somewhere, and you rescued him in a goddam boat, he'd want
        to know who the guy was that was rowing it before he'd even get in. I told him Mal Brossard was
        going. He said, "That bastard . . . All right. Wait a second." You'd think he was doing you a big
        favor.
