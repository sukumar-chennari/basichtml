    <pre>
                “Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”
                My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get
                rich, Son?”
                “Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and
                they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three
                of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t
                invited because we were poor kids.”
                “They did?” my dad asked incredulously.
                “Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.
                My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his
                nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.
                The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate,
                I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their
                kids. We were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of
                the plantation and the other affluent people, such as doctors, business
                owners, and bankers, sent their children to this elementary school.
                After grade six, their children were generally sent off to private
                schools.

    <pre>
            In 1990, Mike took over his father’s empire and is, in fact,
            doing a better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice
            a year on the golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you
            could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now
            grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us.
            In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was 37.
            Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring
            unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our
            wealth grows automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets
            are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You
            water it for years, and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its
            roots are implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for
            your enjoyment.
            Mike chose to run the empire, and I chose to retire.
            Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would
            recommend that they do. “How do I get started?” “Is there a book
            you would recommend?” “What should I do to prepare my children?”
            “What is your secret to success?” “How do I make millions?”

    <pre>
                In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s, was asked to
            speak to the MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin. A friend
            of mine was a student in that MBA class. After a powerful and
            inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if he
            would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray
            graciously accepted.
            “What business am I in?” Ray asked, once the group had all their
            beers in hand.
            “Everyone laughed,” my friend said. “Most of the MBA students
            thought Ray was just fooling around.”
            No one answered, so Ray asked again, “What business do you
            think I’m in?”
            The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled
            out, “Ray, who in the world doesn’t know that you’re in the
            hamburger business?”
            Ray chuckled. “That’s what I thought you would say.” He paused and
            then quickly added, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger
            business. My business is real estate.”

    <p id="chap4"><b>Lesson 4: The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations </b>
    <pre>
                    I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and
            his Merry Men. My teacher thought it was a wonderful story of a
            romantic hero who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich
            dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.
            Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. I often
            still hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” or “The rich
            should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.”
            It is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to
            the poor, that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle
            class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the
            Robin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the
            middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who
            pays for the poor.
            Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look
            at the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an
            expert on the history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as
            an expert on the history of taxes

    <p id="chap5"><b>Lesson 5: The Rich Invent Money </b>
    <pre>
                Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV
            program on the history of a young man named Alexander Graham
            Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone and was having growing
            pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong.
            Needing a bigger company, he then went to the giant at that time,
            Western Union, and asked them if they would buy his patent and
            his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The
            president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down,
            saying the price was ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-
            dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born.
            The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander
            Graham Bell. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a
            local company. The workers were angry and complained that the
            company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about
            45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was
            begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would
            reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was
            afraid of losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the
            world to see. Needless to say, it held my attention.
