        <summary><b>Rohit Sharma</b></summary>
        <p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who currently captains the
            India national cricket team across all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best
            batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known for his
            timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which
            famously include most sixes in international cricket,[a] most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most
            centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is
            the first player to score 5 T20I centuries.[5] He plays for Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic
            cricket.</p>

            <b>Achievements</b> <br>
            Sharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match,
            with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014.[6] He is the only
            player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket.[108] In January 2020,
            Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[109] During the
            2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket
            World Cup.[110]

            On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two
            centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[111] In the same series, he broke
            Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.[112]

            On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against
            Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international
            sixes (553).[113] His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach
            this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.[114]

            On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to
            complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.[115] This feat occurred during a highly anticipated
            India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 100,000 enthusiastic fans.[116] The
            Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant Strokeplay
            has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one
            of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.

        <summary><b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b></summary>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920), the man who reshaped twentieth-century mathematics with his various
            contributions in several mathematical domains, including mathematical analysis, infinite series, continued
            fractions, number theory, and game theory is recognized as one of history's greatest mathematicians. Leaving
            this world at the youthful age of 32, Ramanujan made significant contributions to mathematics that only a
            few others could match in their lifetime. Surprisingly, he never received any formal mathematics training.
            Most of his mathematical discoveries were based only on intuition and were ultimately proven correct. With
            its humble and sometimes difficult start, his life story is just as fascinating as his incredible work.
            Every year, Ramanujan’s birth anniversary on December 22 is observed as National Mathematics Day.

            Born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramanujan demonstrated an exceptional intuitive grasp of mathematics at a
            young age. Despite being a mathematical prodigy, Ramanujan's career did not begin well. He received a
            college scholarship in 1904, but he quickly lost it by failing in nonmathematical subjects. Another attempt
            at college in Madras (now Chennai) ended in failure when he failed his First Arts exam. It was around this
            time that he began his famous notebooks. He drifted through poverty until 1910 when he was interviewed by R.
            Ramachandra Rao, secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was initially sceptical of Ramanujan, but
            he eventually recognised his abilities and supported him financially.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Achievements</b><br>
            The year after his death, Nature listed Ramanujan among other distinguished scientists and mathematicians on
            a "Calendar of Scientific Pioneers" who had achieved eminence.[128] Ramanujan's home state of Tamil Nadu
            celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan's birthday) as 'State IT Day'. Stamps picturing Ramanujan were issued by
            the government of India in 1962, 2011, 2012 and 2016.[129]
